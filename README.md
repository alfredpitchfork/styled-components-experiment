This is one of my experiments. There was originally tutorial that I was following to test out design patterns and styling animations. The original tutorial just used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla javascript. I challenged myself by adapting that code into a React environment, then a Next.js environment, and then to finally adapt it to be used through styled components. I really liked the refactoring that styled components was able to provide.

My idea was that if I invested my time to adopt styled-componenets, and stored them in a central datapoint, eventually I would have pre-made, pre-styled, and reusable components that I could just pluck, plug and drop into any project. My own personal component library, but unique across different styles-scapes and projects. I would then store them all in a monolithic datapoint, only fetch the component on render, to create statically-generated pages, leverage the rehydration capability of next.js. Down the line, there could be 15 projects, all fetching the same component to make it a reusable component, not just in the scope of a project but across multiple websites.

Sadly, I never got that far. The rate that the packages and their dependencies deprecattng was too fast for me to keep a stable testing environment. I was too inexperienced and lacked both knowledge and skill for such an ambitious undertaking. As fun as this endeavor was, it was still a hobby and a side-project. So here it waits while I go back to college to work on my CS degree, until the day that I can come back and take on the challenge again.

There is a current live version deployed through vercel at the following web address:
